## [1.7.2] - 2020-01-18
### Fixed
- Patched Django to 2.2.9 to address vulnerability.

## [1.7.1] - 2019-09-09
### Fixed
- Fixed Gunicorn settings to support async worker threads. This is necessary to support larger snapshots that take longer to upload to Google Drive. I should've had it configured this way from the start in v 1.7.0.

## [1.7.0] - 2019-08-29
### Fixed
- Updated Django to 2.1.11 to address vulnerabilities
### Fixed
- Added Gunicorn as the web server. Previously was just using Django's development server - not good practice, I know. I was lazy.

## [1.6.2] - 2019-06-28
### Fixed
- Updated Django to 2.1.9 and updated urllib3 to 1.24.2 to address vulnerabilities

## [1.6.1] - 2019-03-19
### Fixed
- Modified config to reduce unnecessary CPU usage.

## [1.6.0] - 2019-03-16
### New
- Added a second service operation called `adhocBackup`. This is completely separate from the normal backup operations performed using the `doBackup` service operation. The new adhoc backups do not rely on the pre-configured options `fromPattern`, `backupDirID`, `purge` and `purge_google`. Instead, an adhoc backup request identifies which files are to be backed up and which Google Drive folder is to be targeted each time it is placed (hence the name, "adhoc"). The concept of "purging" of older files while preserving more recent files does not apply at all to adhoc backups. Adhoc backups simply copy each identified file from your hass[]().io host to your Google Drive, **replacing the target file on Google Drive if it already exists**.
### Fixed
- Added a paragraph in the readme file providing add-on installation instructions.
- Added some additional debugging log entries - in case of emergency.

## [1.5.2] - 2019-02-27
### Fixed
- Changed to use Python base build in attempt to avoid segmentation faults being experienced by users on 64 bit Hassos.

## [1.5.1] - 2019-02-19
### Fixed
- Changed MQTT topic from retain=True to retain=False. If you happened to install and use version 1.5.0 of the Google Backup add-on, you will have a retained backup result event stored in MQTT. You can remove this by using Home Assistant's mqtt.publish service to send the following message. This will clear out the previously retained message.
        ```
        {
          "topic": "googlebackup/result",
          "retain": true
        }
        ```


## [1.5.0] - 2019-02-18
### Added
- Now publishing result JSON object as an MQTT event.
### Fixed
- Built using latest version of hass[]()io builder in hope to eliminate seqmentation fault being experienced by some users. 

## [1.4.0] - 2019-02-14
### Added
- Improved logging and added option to run in DEBUG mode.
### Fixed
- Upgraded Django from 2.1.2 to 2.1.7 patching security vulnerabilities.
