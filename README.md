# hassio-repository
I no longer have a Home Assistant environment, and am not in a position to support this add-on anymore. I appologize for the inconvenience. I'm really not sure how to "drop support" of something like this. The code is available for anyone to take it, if they want. I think I remember seeing that there's another add-on similar to mine that may even be better.

## Add-ons in this Repository
Okay. There's really only one add-on in this repository. And, there probably won't ever be any others.
