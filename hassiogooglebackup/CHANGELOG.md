## [1.5.1] - 2019-02-19
### Fixed
- Changed MQTT topic from retain=True to retain=False. If you happened to install and use version 1.5.0 of the Google Backup add-on, you will have a retained backup result event stored in MQTT. You can remove this by using Home Assistant's mqtt.publish service to send the following message. This will clear out the previously retained message.
        ```
        {
          "topic": "googlebackup/result",
          "retain": true
        }
        ```
